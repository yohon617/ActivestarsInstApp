<h1>Login problem </h1>
<p>***If you are experiencing problem trying to login or register for an event, it might be because your security level of your brower is set to High, and it is preventing javascripts to run on our system. One solution is to change you security level down one level to Medium, or added our site to the Trusted Site group under security and set that group's security level to Medium, that way you will still get protection from visiting other web sites.***</p>
<p> 1. Go to our site's login page.<br>
2. Press <B>ALT+D</B> to select the Web address, and press <B>CTRL+C</B> to copy it to the Windows Clipboard.</p>
<p>  This saves you from having to type it later. <br>

      </strong>4. Click the <B>Security</B> tab, and then click the security zone where you want to add the site: <B>Local intranet</B>, <B>Trusted sites</B>, or <B>Restricted sites</B>. (In our case, pick Trusted sites) <br>

  <br>
  7. Click the <B>Add</B> button.</p>
<p><B>Note:</B> If Internet Explorer asks for confirmation, click to remove the check in the <B>Require server verification</B> box. Click the <strong>Add </strong>button again. After the site is added to the group, make sure you re-check the <B>Require server verification</B> box, so no other non-secured site can be added to your trusted group. </p>
<p>8. Click <B>OK</B> twice. </p>
